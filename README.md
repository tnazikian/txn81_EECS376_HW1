# EECS 376 Assignment 1
## STDR Open-Loop Control by Toshiki Nazikian (txn81)

This assignment simulates a robot in a maze traveling from the lower-left corner to the upper-left corner. 
The robot does not rely on any sensor input, and each lateral and rotational movement is hard-coded in
the open loop commander.
